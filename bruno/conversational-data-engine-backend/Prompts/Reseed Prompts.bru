  Reseeds all prompts from the default constants (prompt.constants.ts) into the database.
  This will update existing prompts with the latest values from the code and create any new prompts.
  After reseeding, prompts are automatically reloaded into memory.
  
  This is useful when:
  - You've updated prompt templates in the code
  - You want to reset prompts to their default values
  - You need to sync the database with the latest prompt definitions
}
